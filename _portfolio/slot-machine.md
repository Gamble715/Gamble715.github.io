This was just a project to get me aquainted to the Swift iOS programming language. The user can bet up to 5 credits and depending on the pattern of the three horizontal rows a payout will be triggered. The succeful patterns are either a three of a kind, a straight, or a flush. It isn't very complex and certainly not beautiful but I still learned some things along the way.

## Lessons Learned

1. #### Swift brings the best of both worlds together.
- Swift is quickly becoming my favorite language to code in. It combines class inheritence found in Object Oriented languages like Ruby with Functional language flavor in the form of closures like JavaScript. Since I know both Ruby and JavaScript so even though it was weird at first I wuickly picked up on some of the design patterns.
2. #### The future of iOS development is bright.
- Before Swift, to build a native iOS application you would have to learn Objective-C. While not the most complex language ever, Obj-C had a steep enough learning curve to give me many false starts in learning iOS development. Swift can directly interface with Obj-C but with its enhanced language capabilities (such as optional types and easier object instantiation) it makes it as easy as possible to learn to develop iOS apps without making your head spin.
