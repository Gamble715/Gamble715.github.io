Affordably was an app by the second startup I worked for, Guava. It's main goal was to take in the user's financial data and analyze it to figure out both fixed and discretionary exenditures. From there the app uses the user's monthly saving goal to compute a daily spending plan. If the user spent under this daily budget, the next day it would recompute and show that they could spend more if they wanted and still make their goals. Likewise, if they overspent then the budget would correct down ensuring the user can still reach his or her monthly goal.

When I arrived at Guava there was a considerable ammount of the app already finished. I was tasked with helping clean it up and conduct customer development to find new features that would be valuable to users. This was a great experience because I wore many hats and operated in all aspects of the startup. In the end it unfortunately failed but it was an experience I would never trade in because it taught me many important lessons.

## Lessons Learned

1. #### Modularize as much code as possible from the get go.
- When I came in, most of the app's logic was in one giant library file, this made it difficult, even painful, at times when a bug would surface and we would have to sift through 2,000 lines of code to find it.

## Poteratque quod tulit vulnus vulnera ut inquit

Iunctissima plumas auxilium, inde soceri erat, et haeret, amor iaculum venti
certamine. Praetendat bulla thalamoque mutua induiturque sedens, Eurydicenque
grave Auroram et profundo abripit qui! **Valles** sententia *vidisse* iubete.

Obvia hic confidit, superatus exit. Aut undas fidae iuvenum praebetque anilia,
