I was contracted to help a consulting agency update their marketing site. Unfortunately things did not work out in the end but the work I did still taught me valuable lessons. I am a big believer that if you cant talk about your failures as well as your successes, you are doomed to repeat your mistakes.

I was working alongside [Justin Crites](https://github.com/j4ustin) on this project. He scoped the project out and gave the client a selection of designs to choose from. From those designs the client piecemealed together their preferred composition. From that point on I was tasked in putting the components together and hand coding the custon components such as the CMS hooks and some of the more complicated JavaScript UI.

Due to the slow nature in which we were paid and recieved feedback Justin decided to drop the client and I never got a chance to fully complete the project. Even though ot ended poorly I still learned a lot about how to work with CMS sites.

## Lessons Learned

1. #### Get on the same page early and often with clients.
- Justin taught me the importance of accurate scoping, but I realized that over the course of the project the scope changed. We tried to keep up with how much it changed but the turnaround time for feedback became too sluggish and the project eventually fell to a standstill. In the future I now know that I must touch base as often as needed even if it means emailing a client every day until I get a response.
2. #### Refactor as soon as a module is working.
- Technical debt becomes more and more expensive the longer it is kept around. Refactoring is most useful right after you get the code to work. At the beginning of this project I was used to refactoring after I finish the file, I soon found that this created inefficiencies in my workflow. When I went back to refactor, even just an hour removed from the code, it was more difficult to infer the essential purpose and thus use the proper design pattern.
3. #### The sooner your live server is set up the better.
- The client may well think you haven't done anything if you can't show your work halfway into the job. Getting a live example up and running will ensure this problem never arises. Always be in a position to show your work, no matter the state it is in.
