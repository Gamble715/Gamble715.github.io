I know what most of you are thinking: "Gamble has a blog? And it doesnt look like shit. He must have gotten smart." I assure you I am still pretty dumb, but if there is one thing learning to code has taught me it is that building a place for yourself on the internet isnt as hard as you would think. You can use free services like wordpress or blogspot to put youself out there, but making it look good will cost you. You can also do what I did and "hack" your way to a beautiful site.

For those of you wondering I am using a static site generator named Jekyll. Static in the web tech sense means that it is not user interactive. The only user input I have is my contact form which is powered by another service altogether. The apps that we use like Gmail or Facebook or even Craigslist are powered by servers that can store and retrieve data. In order for me to write my posts I must delve into the code and write in markdown, which is a word processing language.

I had many attempts at making a blog earlier in my life. They all sputtered either because I didnt have much to say, or I was embarassed by how it looked. Now that I can more handily wield CSS, HTML and JavaScript I felt ready to give it another go, that is what you are looking at right now. I pay exactly $0 for this site because the fine folks at GitHub decided to let people host static sites for free. Isn't the open source community swell? If you would like to learn how to build a site like this one please drop me a line and I can point you to some great resources and get you started on the right foot.
