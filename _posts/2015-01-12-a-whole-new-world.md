Everyone has an interpretation of life. A buhddist monk in Nepal who thinks life is a path to enlightenment or a counter-culture twentysomething in Europe who says life is a struggle against authority. We all have this concept of life in common, but the way it manifests within us varies from person to person; from experience to experience. Since this is my inaugural post I feel it necessary to get my outlook on life out of the way to set the stage for whatever may be written on these pages later on down the road.

To me, life is an adventure.

In some respects it could be quite literal. An African refugee escaping a military coup having to travel hundreds of miles to safety. In other respects it could be more metaphorical. An American teen trying to find herself in the chaotic brushfire of highschool trends and shortlived relationships.

All the while time marches forward, pushing the past behind us and stretching the future before us. We as human beings can only sense time linearly. Like a car on a road, in order to move from a to z you must pass through b to y to get there. Some people actively realize time can only go in one direction and they savor the journey. They realize there is no point in going anywhere if the way to get there does not benefit them.

My adventure has brought me to Austin. Born in the mild summer of a place known for its cold winters I am far from home and even further from my past. A year and a half ago I made the decision to move geographically and intellectually. I shifted to the digital west, switching my career path from managing people and supply chains, to talking to computers. The impact of that change will no doubt show itself through my writing here, and I hope at least one person (perhaps myself) will benefit.

If this is all you read from me know that all of life is a miracle in the first place, and an adventure in the last.
